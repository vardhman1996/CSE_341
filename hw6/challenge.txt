Enhancements:
1) Gradual but faster movement of block on pressing the 'z' key.
    Binded the 'z' to a proc and defined the function where the parent
    function run was called. Scores were added for each time the key 'z'
    was pressed to indicate a 'good' thing in the game to use a faster
    block movement.

2) Cheat as the cost of 200 points to remove the bottom two rows regardless
   of how full they are.
    Binded the 'p' to a proc that calls a newly defined function in the
    board class. The remove_two function checks for the current score
    if this score is greater than 200 then it removes any elements from
    the last two rows and sets those positions to nil. Then it moves down
    all the rows above it by iterating over the grid's list and moving
    individual lists inside the grid list and then adds 2 new lists at the
    top to clearly represent the grid.
